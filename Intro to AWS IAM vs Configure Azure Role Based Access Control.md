# AWS Intro to IAM / Azure Configure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## AWS: Intro to IAM

### What I did in the lab:
- Used the AWS management console to explore IAM.
- Created IAM groups and attached permissions. 
- Created IAM users, assigned them to groups.
- Logged in as the new users to test and confirm the access based on policies.
- Learned how different users had different access levels based on the group policies I set.

- Assigned roles to users or groups using RBAC.
- Verified access by checking the permissions.
- Used Azures IAM to manage and review role assignments.

I couldn't find where the MSLE grades are saved? So I only have this screenshot that shows I have attempted the lab:
